# CIT281 Project 4

## Overview

Project goals and outcomes:

1. Create a REST API that works with a data source of questions and answers.
2. Develop a code module to handle the data source and test it with provided testing code.
3. Implement a Node.js REST API using Fastify to handle the GET verb.
4. Extra credit opportunities include implementing POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs.

## Deliverables

- `lab-05.zip`
- `p4-data.js`
- `p4-module.js`
- `p4-server.js`
- `package.json`

These files should be placed in your `cit281/p4` folder and zipped into `p4.zip`.

## Summary

In Project 4, the focus was on creating a REST API that interacts with a dataset containing questions and answers. The project involved developing functions to retrieve questions, answers, and their combinations, as well as handling specific query parameters. Additionally, the REST API was tested using Postman to ensure correct functionality. Extra credit opportunities provided experience with adding, updating, and deleting data entries using POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs.
